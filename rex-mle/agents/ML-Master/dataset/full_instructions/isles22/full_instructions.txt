You are participating in *Med-MLE-bench*, an offline version of Kaggle or Grand Challenge competitions adapted to test the coding ability of agents like yourself.

You will be given a machine learning task. You must solve the task by training a model and running the model on the test set to produce a submission file. You may not hand-label the data to produce a submission file.

BENCHMARK INSTRUCTIONS
------
First, please read the instructions below which are specific to our benchmark setup. Note, these instructions can be found again in `instructions.txt`.

- **Competition-specific instructions**: The instructions for the competition are available in `input/description.md`. Read this file to understand the problem setup for the competition you are currently solving.
- **Dataset**: The dataset files for the competition are available in `input/`.
- **Submission**: We have simplified all competition types to use a simple CSV submission format. Regardless of what the competition instructions say, you MUST produce a submission file at `submission/submission.csv`. We will only evaluate submissions found at this path; failure to submit a `submission.csv` at this path will result in a failed attempt.
- **Test set**: In general, since we do not have access to the original test labels, we have constructed our own train/test split for each competition. As such, the dataset you see in `input/` may differ slightly from what is described in the competition instructions. Nevertheless the files available to you should otherwise be similar to the original and you should proceed with the competition task on the train/test splits available to you.
- **Submission checker**: We provide a tool for checking the validity of your submission file, in the form of a server endpoint at `http://localhost:5001/validate`. If you post a submission file to the server (e.g. `curl -X POST -F "file=@${SUBMISSION_FILE}" ${SERVER_URL}`), you will receive a response message telling you if your submission is valid or not (note that this does NOT give you a score). For your convenience, we provide a script `validate_submission.sh` which can help you make this submission to the validation server.
- **Cheating**: You are not allowed to view others' solutions to this competition. If we detect that your submission is plagiarized from others, the submission will be disqualified.

Your submission will be graded based on the metric in the competition-specific instructions. Your goal is to achieve the best score possible on the competition task.

Wherever there is a conflict between the points above and the competition-specific instructions in `input/description.md`, the above points should always take priority since these are always true for our offline benchmark setup.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
------

- **Compute**: You have access to 1 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB with the appropriate drivers installed.
- **Total Runtime**: You have a maximum of 24hours 0mins 0secs hours to attempt this task. You may iteratively develop your solution within this time frame, but bear in mind that program runtime also counts towards this limit.
- **Total Steps**: You have a maximum of 500 steps to submit your solution.
- You will be informed of the remaining time and steps at each step.
- **Use as much of the available time as possible to refine and optimize your submission**: Your goal is to achieve the best possible score, not just to submit your first working solution. Consider strategies like validating your answer using the "Validate Submission" tool at the http://localhost:5000/validate endpoint, manually spot-checking predictions, building custom validation sets and grading functions, and comparing different algorithms. You may keep working until the time limit expires -- as long as your best submission is stored at the designated location at the end of your run, it will be picked up for grading.

# ISLES'22 - Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation Challenge

**Challenge Website:** https://isles22.grand-challenge.org/
**Year:** 2022
**Conference:** MICCAI 2022
**Data License:** CC BY 4.0
**Dataset:** https://zenodo.org/record/7960856
**Challenge Document:** https://zenodo.org/record/6362388

## Overview

The Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation Challenge (ISLES'22) focuses on **multimodal MRI infarct segmentation in acute and sub-acute stroke**. This challenge evaluates automated methods for stroke lesion segmentation using DWI, ADC, and FLAIR MR modalities.

## Background

Infarct segmentation in ischemic stroke is crucial at different disease stages:

1. **Acute stages**: Guide treatment decision-making
   - Whether to reperfuse or not
   - Type of treatment selection

2. **Sub-acute and chronic stages**: Evaluate disease outcome
   - Patient clinical follow-up
   - Define optimal therapeutic and rehabilitation strategies
   - Maximize critical windows for recovery

## Task Definition

**Goal:** Automatically generate stroke lesion segmentation masks from multimodal MRI images.

**Input Modalities:**
- **DWI** (Diffusion Weighted Imaging, b=1000)
- **ADC** (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient map)
- **FLAIR** (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery)

**Output:** Binary segmentation mask delineating ischemic stroke lesions

## Key Features of ISLES'22

### 1. Broader Lesion Spectrum
- **Not only large infarcts** but also **multiple embolic and/or cortical infarcts**
- Typical patterns seen after mechanical recanalization
- Variable lesion size and burden

### 2. Temporal Coverage
- **Pre-intervention MRI**: Very early disease state
- **Post-intervention MRI**: Sub-acute infarct patterns not restricted to single vessel territory

### 3. Enhanced Dataset
- **~3x more data than ISLES'15** (previous similar challenge)
- **250 expert-annotated cases** for training
- **150 hidden cases** for testing

### 4. Multi-Center Data
- Retrospective data from three stroke centers
- Multiple scanner types and field strengths
- Real-world clinical variability

## Differences from Previous ISLES Editions

ISLES'22 differs from previous challenge editions by:

1. **Targeting complex infarct patterns**
   - Not just single large lesions
   - Multiple embolic infarcts
   - Cortical infarcts

2. **Dual temporal assessment**
   - Pre-interventional imaging
   - Post-interventional imaging

3. **Increased data volume and diversity**
   - Larger dataset (~3x ISLES'15)
   - Multi-center acquisition
   - Variable anatomical locations

4. **Clinical relevance**
   - Growing interest in acute embolic infarct patterns
   - Post-interventional sub-acute patterns
   - Wider disease spectrum representation

## Clinical Significance

From a clinical perspective, ISLES'22 addresses:

- **Acute embolic infarct patterns** (pre-intervention)
- **Post-interventional sub-acute patterns** (after mechanical recanalization)
- **Multiple infarcts** not restricted to a single vessel territory
- **Variable lesion burden** across different anatomical locations

## Technical Challenges

Participants will face:

- **Wider ischemic stroke disease spectrum**
- **Variable lesion size and burden**
- **More complex infarct patterns**
- **Variable anatomically located lesions**
- **Multi-center data variability**

## Dataset Structure

### Training Data (250 cases)
Each case includes:
- 3 MRI modalities (DWI, ADC, FLAIR)
- Expert-level stroke lesion annotations
- Clinical metadata (when available)

### File Format
- **Format:** NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative)
- **Convention:** BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)
- **Native space:** No prior registration applied
- **Preprocessing:** Skull-stripping for patient de-identification

### Scanner Details
