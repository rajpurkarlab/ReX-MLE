  # Clinical context
  clinical_focus:
    - "Acute embolic infarct patterns"
    - "Pre-intervention (early disease state)"
    - "Post-intervention (sub-acute patterns)"
    - "Multiple embolic and/or cortical infarcts"

  # Challenge features
  features:
    - "Multimodal MRI (DWI, ADC, FLAIR)"
    - "Acute and sub-acute stroke lesions"
    - "Multiple embolic and cortical infarcts"
    - "Pre- and post-interventional MRI"
    - "~3x more data than ISLES'15"

  # Key differences from previous ISLES editions
  innovations:
    - "Targets both large and multiple small embolic/cortical infarcts"
    - "Evaluates both pre- and post-interventional MRI"
    - "Wider ischemic stroke disease spectrum"
    - "More complex infarct patterns"
    - "Variable anatomical locations"
